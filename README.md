# Todo List Decentralized app

This app was built to show understanding of Decentralized apps as the final project for Backend Web 2.4 at Make School.

The app was based off freeCodeCamp.org tutorial that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coQ5dg8wM2o&feature=youtu.be&t=413&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
